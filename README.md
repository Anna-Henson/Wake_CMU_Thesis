# Wake - CMU Thesis
Wake is a Guided Mixed Reality Experience for one participant in-headset, one dancer, and one facilitator. Wake immerses a participant in a virtual environment and uses spoken instructions and movement to facilitate a participantâ€™s navigation of this space, interact with virtual and tangible objects, and encounter a co-located and virtually present dancer who invites the participant to join in simple collaborative movement.
